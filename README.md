#Cryptixhash v2

Cryptixhash v2 is a newly developed hash algorithm designed to resist specialized hardware attacks, particularly from FPGAs and ASICs. The goal is to achieve an optimal balance between CPU and GPU mining, making specialized hardware economically unviable. ASIC and FPGA Resistance ‚Äì A Realistic Approach

It‚Äôs important to distinguish between resistance and immunity:

Resistance means making ASICs and FPGAs inefficient so that their use is not economically viable.
Immunity means making them completely unusable, which is not a realistic long-term goal.

Our Approach
We acknowledge that 100% resistance against specialized hardware is not permanently achievable, as hardware constantly evolves. However, by implementing specific measures, we can significantly reduce the efficiency of ASICs and FPGAs, making them non-profitable to develop and deploy. Key Goals of Cryptixhash v2

Achieve an optimal balance between CPU and GPU mining without favoring one too much.
Make ASICs and FPGAs inefficient, discouraging their development and usage.
Slow down and increase the cost of developing specialized hardware, making implementation complex and time-consuming.

Technical Strategies for Resistance


1. Memory Intensity as a Defense Mechanism


One of the main weaknesses of ASICs and FPGAs is their limited memory and low memory bandwidth.
Memory-hard algorithms require large amounts of memory, preventing efficient caching on specialized hardware.
Dynamic memory access patterns, dependent on previous computations, further hinder ASIC optimizations.

‚úÖ Advantage: Severely limits ASIC and FPGA efficiency.
‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: Excessive memory requirements can also slow down GPUs‚Äîfinding a balance is crucial.


2. Unpredictability and Adaptive Computation

ASICs and FPGAs thrive on predictability, allowing them to optimize their circuits for predefined operations.

Solution: Introduce dynamic computation adjustments based on the previous hash value.
This prevents specialized hardware from precomputing or optimizing pipeline execution.
‚úÖ Advantage: Eliminates precomputed optimizations for ASICs and FPGAs.
‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: GPUs still require some level of structure‚Äîtoo much randomness could also impact performance.


3. Non-Linearity to Limit Parallelization

ASICs and FPGAs excel at linear, highly parallel computations. To counteract this, Cryptixhash v2 employs non-linear operations to make parallelization difficult:

Non-linear memory accesses that dynamically change.
A mix of mathematical transformations and memory-heavy operations.
Adaptive workloads, influenced by previous hash results, reducing predictability.
‚úÖ Advantage: Prevents efficient hardware pipelining.
‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: GPUs also rely on parallel execution‚Äîa careful balance is needed.


4. Dynamic S-Boxes for Increased Resistance

Another approach is the use of dynamic S-Boxes, similar to cryptographic implementations (e.g., AES).

These S-Boxes change dynamically during the hashing process, preventing ASICs and FPGAs from relying on fixed optimizations.
Benefit: Specialized hardware is forced to recalculate S-Boxes constantly, reducing efficiency.

‚úÖ Advantage: Significantly increases resistance against ASIC and FPGA optimizations.
‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: GPUs could also be affected‚ÄîS-Boxes must be designed to remain GPU-friendly.


Summary: Resistant Yet Balanced for CPUs & GPUs

Cryptixhash v2 integrates multiple mechanisms to make ASICs and FPGAs ineffective and unprofitable while ensuring CPUs and GPUs remain viable for mining.

‚úÖ Memory intensity limits specialized hardware.
‚úÖ Adaptive computation prevents predictability and pipelining.
‚úÖ Non-linearity reduces parallel execution efficiency.
‚úÖ Dynamic S-Boxes disrupt ASIC optimization strategies.
These measures position Cryptixhash v2 as a future-proof solution that is well-equipped to counter specialized hardware attacks.



Is There 100% Resistance Against ASICs and FPGAs?

ASICs are not reprogrammable, meaning they are designed for a specific algorithm and cannot be adapted afterward. This makes them less of a threat since even minor changes to the hashing algorithm can render these devices useless. A manufacturer investing in specialized ASICs risks significant financial losses if their hardware becomes obsolete due to a simple software update and gets returned by users.
FPGAs, on the other hand, are programmable, making them a greater challenge. Our strategy is not to block ASICs or FPGAs entirely‚Äîsince this is hardly achievable in the long run‚Äîbut rather to drastically reduce their efficiency. If specialized hardware cannot achieve significant performance gains over CPUs and GPUs, it loses its economic viability. This is further reinforced by network rules that prohibit specialized hardware.
A 100% immunity against FPGAs does not exist for hybrid CPU and GPU hashes. For pure CPU hashes, temporary immunity is possible‚Äîsuch as through JIT compilation, which dynamically alters code execution. However, implementing this approach while maintaining GPU support is far more difficult. Targeted hardware bottlenecks can provide some resistance, especially if manufacturers rely on outdated or inefficient hardware designs.
We believe that absolute protection against FPGAs does not exist, but protection against efficiency and profitability does. Through specific design choices, FPGA mining can be significantly slowed down and made economically unfeasible. An essential factor is the long development time required for FPGA implementations‚Äîif an algorithm is frequently modified or relies on complex, non-linear computations, it becomes challenging and costly to develop efficient FPGA solutions. This is exactly the approach we are taking.

Will we make it? Let's be surprised, we will do our best.
